I'm an entrepreneur, designer and engineer that enjoys helping humans understand machines and vice-versa.
I recommend you get started by [reading my latest update](/updates/09-2025).

Occasionally write about humanism, philosphy:

- [Your writing is your craft.](/writing/writing-is-your-craft)
- [You should rarely be the loudest person in the room.](/writing/loudest-in-the-room)

and technology, design: 

- [Using Git to back up my Google Docs. (Soon)](#)

I also provide consulting services on product-led growth, product strrategy, and design for startups and enterprises.
Previous clients include Centralny OÅ›rodek Informatyki, Artificial Labs, Optio Inecentives, Novonesis, Ministry of Digital Affairs and more.
